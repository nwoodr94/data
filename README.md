## Welcome

Welcome to my data science and machine learning portfolio.

### [Machine Learning / Deep Learning](https://nwoodr94.github.io/machine-learning/)
This repository contains projects involving real use cases of machine learning algorithms, and more advanced deep learning models.

### [Python](https://nwoodr94.github.io/python-projects/)
Python shows my ability to use common data science libraries to perform statistics, hypothesis testing, visualization, and calculus.

### [C/C++](https://nwoodr94.github.io/cpp-projects/)
C/C++ is where I host scientific projects dealing with microprocessors, sensors, and actuators.

### [SQL](https://nwoodr94.github.io/sql-projects/)
SQL is where I perform data manipulation tasks such as A/B testing, data mining, and other advanced queries.

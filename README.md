1. Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Naive Bayes
5. Logistic Regression
6. Decision Trees
7. Random Forests
8. The Perceptron
9. Minimax
10. K-Means Clustering

### [Python](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects)
The Python repository shows my ability to use the python data science libraries to perform statistics, hypothesis testing, visualization, and calculus used in machine learning libraries.
1. Numpy
2. SciPy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly
5. Machine Learning Algorithms

### [SQL](https://github.com/nwoodr94/sql-projects)

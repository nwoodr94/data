## Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Here you will find every project I have accomplished!

### [Machine Learning](https://github.com/nwoodr94/machine-learning)
This Machine Learning repository showcases projects involving real use cases of machine learning algorithms, developed initially by mathematics, and later through an implementation of the scikit-learn library.

### [Python](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects)
The Python repository shows my ability to use the python data science libraries to perform statistics, hypothesis testing, visualization, and calculus used in machine learning libraries.

### [SQL](https://github.com/nwoodr94/sql-projects)
This is a SQL repository, where I perform data manipulation tasks such as A/B testing, and other advanced queries.

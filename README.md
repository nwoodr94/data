## Welcome

Welcome to my data science and machine learning portfolio.

### [Machine Learning / Deep Learning](https://nwoodr94.github.io/machine-learning/)
This repository contains projects involving real use cases of machine learning algorithms, and more advanced deep learning models.

### [Python](https://github.com/nwoodr94/python-projects#python-projects)
Python shows my ability to use common data science libraries to perform statistics, hypothesis testing, visualization, and calculus used in machine learning algorithms.

### [Dashboarding](https://github.com/nwoodr94/dashboards#dashboards)
Dashboarding has custom and deployable dashboards designed to interact with clients or users.

### [SQL](https://github.com/nwoodr94/sql-projects#sql-projects)
SQL is where I perform data manipulation tasks such as A/B testing, and other advanced queries.
